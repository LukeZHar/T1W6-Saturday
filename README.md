# T1W6-Saturday

# If-else Practise Activity

## Building a calculator 
Build a calculator that takes 3 inputs from the user:
2 inputs as numbers (floats) for operation and 3rd input to decide which operation they want to perform 

# Lists 
A collection of inputs stored in a single domain. Composite Data type, meaning multiple data types can be stored in one variable. Each piece is called an element.

# Loops 
Like post malone describes, "Run away, but we're running in circles"
Used to repeat a block of code multiple times until a certain condition is met.

Dry Coding Principle: Don't repeat yourself!!

Example: Counting coins in your piggy bank

'if' condition would decide whether or not to run the intended block. Whereas, Loops would decide how many time the user wants to run the intended block.

# While loop 
While the condition is met, keep executing the intended block, if not met skip.

Things to consider
    - Program can enter the loop
    - Program can exit the loop

## Range
It's a pre-defined function that generates a sequence of numbers.

Useful: Loops for iterating a specific number of times over a sequence of numbers. 

range(start, stop, step)
range(5)

## For Loop
For each item in a sequence, execute the inteded statement.

for variable_name in sequence:
    stmts

## Practise example 1
Finding the sum of the first numbers (1, 2, 3 .... 10)

## Practise example 2
Find the largest number in the list
list = [3, 41, 12, 9, 74, 15]

# Loop control statements 
Control the flow of the loop, terminate the loop early if you want or skip over some iteration

## Break satement
Terminates loop immediately, moves to the next statement after the loop

## Continue statement
skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next
